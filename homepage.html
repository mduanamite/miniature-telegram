PURPOSE: Create a homepage for shahglasscollection.com.
The homepage will contain a welcome message paragraph and a slideshow 
of rotating photos selected from a gallery. It will also have a navbar.

MODIFICATION HISTORY: Javascript code was added by Michelle Duan to the 
document to make the rotating slide show possible.
It was found that attribute "name" was required for slideshow.

<h3> Welcome. </h3>
<p>
This website is my attempt to share my collection and my journey in the world of studio glass.  
For this scientist, who used clear borosilicate glass apparatus in the lab, 
studio glass, with its vibrant and often riotous color palette, was an exciting new world.  
I have enjoyed learning about the use of glass as an artistic medium, 
have marveled at the amazing works of art and have had the privilege to meet many wonderful people - 
artists, gallery owners and fellow collectors.
